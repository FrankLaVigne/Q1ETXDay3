Thief Special Abilities; 2. Open Locks, Pick Pockets, and Remove Traps; 3. Class Restrictions and Level Progression\nse abilities, as determined by the GM. The GM may choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player to help maintain the proper state of uncertainty. Also   note   that   the   GM   may   apply situational   adjustments   (plus   or   minus   percentage points) as they see fit; for instance, it's obviously harder to climb a wall slick with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a penalty of 20% for the slimy wall.\n\n## BASIC FANTASY RPG\n\n## Thief Abilities\n\n|   Thief Level |   Open Locks |   Remove Traps |   Pick Pockets |   Move Silently |   Climb Walls |   Hide |   Listen |\n|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|----------|\n|             1 |           25 |             20 |             30 |              25 |            80 |     10 |       30 |\n|             2 |           30 |             25 |             35 |              30 |            81 |     15 |       34 |\n|             3 |           35 |             30 |             40 |              35 |            82 |     20 |       38 |\n|             4 |           40 |             35 |             45 |              40 |            83 |     25 |       42 |\n|             5 |           45 |             40 |             50 |              45 |            84 |     30 |       46 |\n|             6 |           50 |             45 |             55 |              50 |            85 |     35 |       50 |\n|             7 |           55 |             50 |             60 |              55 |            86 |     40 |       54 |\n|             8 |           60 |             55 |             65 |              60 |            87 |     45 |       58 |\n|             9 |           65 |             60 |             70 |              65 |            88 |     50 |       62 |\n|            10 |           68 |             63 |             74 |              68 |            89 |     53 |       65 |\n|            11 |           71 |             66 |             78 |              71 |            90 |     56 |       68 |\n|            12 |           74 |             69 |             82 |              74 |            91 |     59 |       71 |\n|            13 |           77 |             72 |             86 |              77 |            92 |     62 |       74 |\n|            14 |           80 |             75 |             90 |              80 |            93 |     65 |       77 |\n|            15 |           83 |             78 |             94 |              83 |            94 |     68 |       80 |\n|            16 |           84 |             79 |             95 |              85 |            95 |     69 |       83 |\n|            17 |           85 |             80 |             96 |              87 |            96 |     70 |       86 |\n|            18 |           86 |             81 |             97 |              89 |            97 |     71 |       89 |\n|            19 |           87 |             82 |             98 |              91 |            98 |\n\nQuestion:\nHow does the Thief's Move Silently ability progress from level 1 to level 15?""}]","[{'content': 'Based on the provided document, the Thief\'s ""Move Silently"" ability progresses as follows from level 1 to level 15:\n\n- Level 1: 25\n- Level 2: 30\n- Level 3: 35\n- Level 4: 40\n- Level 5: 45\n- Level 6: 50\n- Level 7: 55\n- Level 8: 60\n- Level 9: 65\n- Level 10: 68\n- Level 11: 71\n- Level 12: 74\n- Level 13: 77\n- Level 14: 80\n- Level 15: 83\n\nThe ability increases incrementally as the Thief levels up, improving the Thief\'s capacity to move without being detected.', 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': None, 'function_call': None, 'provider_specific_fields': {'refusal': None}}]","Based on the provided document, the Thief's ""Move Silently"" ability progresses as follows from level 1 to level 15:
