"Can a GM adjust the Thief's ability scores, and for what reason?","Yes, a Game Master (GM) can adjust a Thief's ability scores in certain situations. The document specifies that the GM may apply situational adjustments, which can either be positive or negative percentage points, to reflect the difficulty of particular actions under specific conditions. For example, climbing a slimy wall is more challenging than climbing a dry one, so the GM might penalize the roll by applying a 20% penalty to the climber's ability score in this scenario. These adjustments help maintain a sense of realism and uncertainty, enhancing the game experience by dynamically altering difficulty based on the situation. The GM also has the discretion to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player to sustain this atmosphere.",YES
Why might a GM apply a situational adjustment when a Thief is climbing a wall?,"A Game Master (GM) might apply a situational adjustment when a Thief is climbing a wall to account for the specific conditions that could make the task more difficult or easier. According to the document, the GM can apply situational adjustments using percentage points to reflect the environmental or situational factors that affect the Thief's ability to climb. For instance, if a wall is ""slick with slime,"" it would be more challenging for the Thief to maintain a grip and climb effectively, and thus the GM might implement a penalty, such as a 20% adjustment, to represent this increased difficulty. Conversely, if the wall has ledges or rough surfaces that provide extra grip, the GM might consider applying a positive adjustment to reflect these advantageous conditions. These adjustments help to maintain uncertainty and realism in the game, ensuring that the environment's impact is considered in the Thief's actions.",YES

Describe a situation where a GM might apply a bonus to a Thief's ability score.,"In a typical gameplay scenario, a Dungeon Master (GM) might apply a bonus to a Thief's ability score when the circumstances are particularly advantageous or favor the Thief's skills. Here is an example situation:

Imagine a Thief character attempting to pick the lock of a door with a highly familiar and simplistic mechanism. The Thief has extensive practice or specific knowledge about this type of lock due to previous encounters. In this case, the GM might determine that the Thief's proficiency or familiarity with the lock warrants a bonus to their roll. 

For instance, if the lock is of a type that the Thief has frequently encountered and successfully picked in past adventures, the GM might grant a bonus of +10% to the Thief's ""Open Locks"" ability score, acknowledging the Thief's expertise in dealing with similar locks. This bonus reflects the increased likelihood of successfully picking the lock due to the Thief's experience and skill. 

On the contrary, any tougher conditions like being under time pressure or dealing with a magically concealed lock might deter bonuses or rather, introduce penalties. This dynamic enforces the influence of situational context in the game.",YES
