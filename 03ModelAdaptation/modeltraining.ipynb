    "# 3. Model Adaptation: Changing What the Model Knows\n",
    "\n",
    "> **GPU Required.** This section requires a CUDA-capable GPU with at least 40GB of memory. The lab environment provides an NVIDIA L40S (46GB). If you are running this outside the lab without GPU access, you can follow the setup and data preparation cells, but training will not execute. Pre-built outputs are provided for that scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now exhausted the options that do not involve changing the model. RAG gave us grounded answers for 6 out of 10 questions. Inference-time scaling (Best-of-N) recovered 2 more. But for the remaining failures, particularly questions requiring implicit domain reasoning, every approach hit the same wall: the model's weights do not contain a reliable path to the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where model adaptation becomes justified. Not because it is the next thing on the list, but because two independent evaluation methods pointed to the same conclusion: the gap is in the model, not in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **OSFT (Orthogonal Subspace Fine-Tuning)**, a parameter-efficient method that updates only the least critical directions in the model's weight matrices while preserving the most important ones. This is not full fine-tuning. It is a controlled modification designed to teach the model new domain knowledge without destroying what it already knows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data comes directly from Section 2: synthetic question-answer pairs generated from the customer's own documents. The model comes from HuggingFace. The training runs locally on GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will have an adapted model and evidence of whether the adaptation closed the gaps that RAG and inference-time scaling could not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Install Training Hub\n",

    "`training_hub` is an open-source library from the Red Hat AI Innovation Team. It provides a single Python interface for multiple post-training algorithms, each backed by a community implementation. You call a function, pass your model and data, and the library handles the rest.\n",
