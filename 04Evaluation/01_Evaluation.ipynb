    "# 4. Evaluation: Did Model Adaptation Close the Gap?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **GPU Required.** This section loads the base model (16GB) plus the LoRA adapter in 4-bit quantization. An NVIDIA GPU with at least 16GB of memory is required. The lab environment provides an NVIDIA L40S (46GB) or L4 (24GB).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now completed three approaches to improving the model's performance on our evaluation questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG (Day 2):** Retrieval-Augmented Generation gave us 6/10 correct answers. Four questions failed due to implicit reasoning gaps.\n",
    "2. **Best-of-N (Section 1):** Inference-time scaling recovered 3 of the 4 failures (q04, q06, q07). Question q02 remained stuck.\n",
    "3. **Model Adaptation (Section 3):** LoRA SFT on 8 Thief-specific training examples. Loss decreased from 2.93 to 2.26 over 5 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section evaluates whether the fine-tuned model closes the remaining gaps. We run two evaluation modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mode 1 — Without RAG Context:** A pure knowledge test. Did the training change what the model knows? We ask the 10 evaluation questions with no retrieved context. This measures whether domain knowledge was absorbed into the weights.\n",
    "- **Mode 2 — With RAG Context:** An apples-to-apples comparison with the Day 2 baseline. Same questions, same retrieved chunks, but with the adapted model. This measures whether the model reasons better over the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data covered only Thief-related topics (8 examples). The evaluation questions span Thieves, Elves, Fighters, Clerics, Magic-Users, Halflings, retainers, and hirelings. We should expect improvement on Thief-adjacent questions and minimal change elsewhere. If the model generalizes beyond its training data, that is a bonus. If it does not, that is a valid and instructive finding."

    "### What the results tell us\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation demonstrates the full pipeline: RAG, inference-time scaling, model adaptation, and structured evaluation. The fine-tuned model's performance should be interpreted in the context of the training setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training constraints:**\n",
    "- **8 training examples** — all focused on Thief abilities. The 10 eval questions span 7 different topics.\n",
    "- **Conservative learning rate** (5e-6 vs typical 1e-4 to 2e-4) — the model updated slowly.\n",
    "- **Modest loss reduction** (2.93 to 2.26) — the model learned something, but didn't fully converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- If the fine-tuned model improved on Thief questions (q01), the training worked as expected for directly covered topics.\n",
    "- If it did not improve on non-Thief questions (q02-q10), that is the expected outcome. You cannot teach a model about Fighter saving throws by training it on Thief ability scores.\n",
    "- If adding RAG context to the fine-tuned model improves results beyond the baseline, the model may have developed better reasoning patterns even from limited training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The bigger picture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a production engagement, you would:\n",
    "1. Generate hundreds or thousands of training examples covering the full domain\n",
    "2. Use a typical learning rate (1e-4 to 2e-4) for LoRA\n",
    "3. Train for more epochs until loss converges (target < 1.0)\n",
    "4. Evaluate on a held-out test set, not the same questions used to guide training\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of this exercise is not the final score — it is the process. You now have a complete, repeatable pipeline from document ingestion through synthetic data generation, model adaptation, and structured evaluation. Each stage has clear inputs, outputs, and decision points. That pipeline is what you bring to a customer engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed discussion of the training caveats and what would change in production, see `caveats.md` in this directory."
