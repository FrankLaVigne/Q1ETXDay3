They are willing to take reasonable risks, including accompanying a player character into dangerous places like dungeons, lairs, or ruins. Retainers are hired for a share of treasure (usually at least 15% of the employer's income) plus support costs, which include weapons, armor, rations, and basic equipment provided by the employer.\n\nOn the other hand, the context does not provide specific details about hirelings other than stating they are another category of NPCs available for hire. It can be inferred that hirelings might not be as loyal or willing to take risks as retainers, but the exact terms of their employment, such as payment and risk tolerance, are not specified in the provided context.

They do not normally go on adventures or enter dungeons.\n\nIn summary, the main difference lies in their roles and capabilities. Retainers are trusted companions who accompany the player character into dangerous situations, while hirelings are ordinary individuals hired for specific tasks and do not typically engage in adventuring or dungeon exploration.",
