If the table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20 to Turn that sort of undead. If the table says 'T' for that combination, that type of undead is automatically affected (no roll needed). If the result shown is a 'D,' then that sort of undead will be Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than merely Turned. The player should always roll, even if the GM knows the character can't succeed (or can't fail), as telling the player whether or not to roll may reveal too much.",

      "answer": "In the Basic Fantasy RPG system, a retainer and a hireling are both types of NPCs that can be hired by player characters. However, the key difference lies in their loyalty and willingness to take risks.\n\nRetainers are close associates of their employer and are typically very loyal. They are willing to take reasonable risks, including accompanying a player character into dangerous places like dungeons, lairs, or ruins. Retainers are hired for a share of treasure (usually at least 15% of the employer's income) plus support costs, which include weapons, armor, rations, and basic equipment provided by the employer.\n\nOn the other hand, the context does not provide specific details about hirelings other than stating they are another category of NPCs available for hire. It can be inferred that hirelings might not be as loyal or willing to take risks as retainers, but the exact terms of their employment, such as payment and risk tolerance, are not specified in the provided context. Therefore, while retainers are described in detail, the distinction between retainers and hirelings beyond loyalty and risk tolerance is not explicitly stated.",

The cost of such learning is in addition to the transcription cost of 500 gp per spell level transcribed into their own spellbook. Often, a Magic-User will learn from their original master for free or in exchange for services. Two Magic-Users may also agree to exchange known spells. In cases where these options are not available, a Magic-User may need to pay another Magic-User (often an NPC) anywhere from 100 gp to 1000 gp per spell level for training. It's important to note that a Magic-User cannot learn or add spells of higher levels to their spellbook.",
