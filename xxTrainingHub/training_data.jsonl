Here's a summary of how each ability changes over these levels:\n\n1. **Open Locks**: Starts at 25% at Level 1 and gradually increases to 87% by Level 19. The increase is steady, with slight acceleration as the levels progress.\n\n2. **Remove Traps**: Begins at 20% and rises to 82% by Level 19. The percentage grows consistently, indicating improved skill in trap removal over time.\n\n3. **Pick Pockets**: Increases from 30% at Level 1 to 98% at Level 19. This is one of the abilities with the most significant growth, peaking at the higher levels.\n\n4. **Move Silently**: Starts at 25% and reaches 91% at Level 19. Like open locks, this ability shows a steady increase with acceleration at higher levels.\n\n5. **Climb Walls**: With a high starting point of 80% at Level 1, it improves to 98% by Level 19. This ability maintains a high percentage throughout and shows minor increases.\n\n6. **Hide**: Begins at 10% and rises to 71% at Level 19. This shows a significant improvement but starts from a lower base compared to other skills.\n\n7. **Listen**: Starts at 30% and improves to 89% by Level 19. Similar to other skills, it exhibits a steady increase.\n\nOverall, as the levels progress, not only do the percentages rise, but the rate of increase tends to accelerate slightly, especially for some skills like picking pockets and open locks. This pattern suggests that as the Thief becomes more experienced, they improve at a faster rate in certain skills."}]}

The document suggests that such adjustments are applied as the GM sees fit. Specifically, the example given in the document indicates a possible penalty of 20% for climbing a wall that is slick with slime. Therefore, a GM might directly reduce the roll for Climb Walls by this percentage to reflect the increased difficulty posed by the slippery conditions."}]}

If yes, how might this affect gameplay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, according to the document, a GM (Game Master) can facilitate rolls for a Thief's abilities if needed. This means that the GM may choose to roll on behalf of the player, which can help maintain the element of uncertainty in the game by not revealing the outcome prematurely. \n\nFacilitating rolls can affect gameplay in several ways:\n\n1. **Maintaining Momentum:** It helps keep the game moving smoothly, as it can be quicker and more convenient for the GM to handle dice rolls, allowing players to focus more on strategy and role-play.\n\n2. **Element of Surprise:** By not revealing whether a roll was successful or not until the GM completes it, it maintains suspense and excitement for both players and GM.\n\n3. **Instructor Role:** It allows the GM to act as a neutral arbiter who ensures that all rules are being followed, which can be especially useful in complex game situations.\n\n4. **Situational Adjustments:** The GM can apply situational adjustments (like penalties for difficult conditions) directly while making the roll, ensuring that all necessary factors are considered in one go.\n\nHowever, as the GM facilitates these rolls, they should maintain impartiality to ensure fairness and avoid giving undue advantage or disadvantage to any player. This approach helps in keeping the gameplay balanced and engaging for all participants."}]}

According to the document, when the wall is covered in slime, it poses additional challenges due to the decreased traction and gripping ability, making it harder for the character to climb. The GM may apply a penalty, such as a 20% reduction in the success percentage of the climb attempt, to account for the increased difficulty posed by the slippery surface. This situational adjustment is used to maintain the game's realism and challenge by incorporating environmental factors into the player's ability checks."}]}
